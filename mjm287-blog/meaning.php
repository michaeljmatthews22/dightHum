I had never heard of Digital Humanities until a friend of mine suggested that I take the class. 
I did not think much of it at the time. My initial thought was that Digital Humanities was a way that people 
with majors based in humanities could get a more technical background. It seemed right. I personally had 
flirted with the idea of majoring in psychology, history or English. </p>
<p>
Even though Digital Humanities is more of a combination of the arts and technology, left-brain and right brain analysis, 
Iâ€™ve come to see more value in diversity.</p>
<p>
It would seem to me that there is an unseen, nearly immeasurable, not-standardized asset that is 
attained with right-brain development. Perhaps, in a way, it can be seen as "soft". If those who criticize humanities 
are trying to make the point that it is a "non-technical" major, then they are completely right, in my mind.
 I believe that they have missed the point. </p>

<p> Perhaps, like my blog posts, I ought to try to strike closer to the definition, but honestly, Digital Humanities is more about
 an idea of the strength of diversity than it is about technologies and particulars. At the end of the day, when everything 
 has been said and done, Digital Humanities is proof that diversity does matter. Coming from a more technical background, 
 I see Digital Humanities as a tool and an asset that will help further the Humanities. Digital Humanities will heighten goals 
 and deepen understanding of language, cultures and art. </p>

 <p>
 Digital Humanities, at the core, represents diversity and well-roundness.
