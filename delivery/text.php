<h2><center>Potion History</center></h2>
<p>According to one site: Potions are the most tricky and precise form of physical magic. In ancient times, witches were always associated with potions and potion-brewing: 
they brewed beauty potions, transmogrification potions, and invisibility potions most often. Potion brewing in ancient times was often viewed as practice fuelled by selfish 
and ill intent, but literature throughout the ages is filled to the brim with potions: love potions, fortune potions, invisibility or invincibility potions, and especially 
potions that affect one’s size (Alice In Wonderland, anyone?) 
</p>
<p>
The term potion comes from the Latin word “potio”, meaning “to drink”. Even primitive potions were able to induce sleep, cause paralysis, poison the body, or cloud the brain,
 and have been used to ages, both to help and to harm. Potions often contain obscure ingredients – things that one often would not consume alone. This is a testament to the 
 true bravery that potion brewing and consuming requires; and thus, many wizards and ancient Muggles alike opted for the easier path using spells or charms. Potions from ancient
 </p><p> Rome and Greece included ingredients such as bats’ blood, crushed beetles, feathers, bird and animal claws, snake skeletons or skins, and many different herbs. Animal parts 
  were often used because it was believed that by consuming part of an animal, you would gain their qualities. For example, by drinking a potion containing bats’ blood, you 
  were supposed to be able to see in the dark (or simply gain highly improved vision). Tortoise shells would increase your lifespan and rabbit’s feet would increase your speed. 
  Modern day polyjuice potions reflect this ancient belief as having some truth behind it: these potions require “extract of The-Transfigured-Being-To-Be”, which is often their hair. 
  This could also be why people where often warned against leaving their belongings places, as it was thought that an evil person could come along and transfigure into you or gain your 
  qualities.
